# amster - Teampot App

An application that allows:
- People (that worked together or not) to self-organize themselves into highly performant and motivated teams that can execute the most diverse and complex projects in an extremely efficient way;
- Organizations/Individuals to easily find these teams that:
  - Can execute complex projects in an extremely efficient way;
  - Have experience of working together;
  - Love and want to work together in the future independantly of their current positions;
  
Why would anyone need an app like this?
- It's hard to create/find/hire highly skilled, cross-functional and motivated teams that can execute project in the most efficient and effective ways from day zero.

As a "People:)": 
 - I want to work in a dream-team formed by the best professionals I ever worked with (or would like to work with);

As an Organization:
 - I want to hire teams of people who love working together and know how to do it in a proper way;
